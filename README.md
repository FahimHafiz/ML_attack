# ML Security Classification

## Description
This repository contains the final project for Machine Learning Security. It includes:
- A Jupyter Notebook (`main_classification.ipynb`) with detailed explanations.
- A Python script (`main_classification.py`) for running the code.
- A dataset used for training and testing the model.

## Dataset
(*Provide dataset details here, including its source, structure, number of samples, and any preprocessing steps applied.*)

## Code Overview
### 1. **main_classification.ipynb**
This Jupyter Notebook provides step-by-step explanations of the implementation, including:
- Data loading and preprocessing.
- Feature extraction and transformation.
- Model training and evaluation.
- Security measures applied to protect the ML model.
- Performance metrics and visualization.

### 2. **main_classification.py**
This script version allows running the entire process from the command line. It includes the same functionalities as the notebook but in a script format.

## Input & Output
### **Inputs:**
- Dataset files (e.g., CSV, images, etc.)
- Configuration settings (if applicable)

### **Outputs:**
- Model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)
- Visualizations (plots, graphs, etc.)
- Trained model files (if applicable)

## How to Run the Code
### **Running the Python Script**
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python main_classification.py
   ```

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, etc.

To install dependencies, run:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
